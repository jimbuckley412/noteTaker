# noteTaker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The purpose of this project is to show we can create a note taker app using express, middleware, node. I created a Repository (noteTaker), cloned it to my computer, and step by step added in a README.md, index.html, script.js, and a style.css then added in the code from the Rutgers Repository.
In the script.js I will create the code needed to run the note taker.  More notes in the script.js file. 
I wanted to utilize what I learned from the lessons to create this note taker.
